TIME SERIES ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------
QUESTION - Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

ANSWER - Yes I would buy the Yen now based on the analysis.  Both the long term and short term trends are showing that the Yen is getting stronger and the forecast from the model verifies this, predicting that the Yen will continue to grow in value relative to the CAD. 

QUESTION - Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

ANSWER - The volatility is predicted to increase, meaning that the risk of the yen will increase in the future. 

QUESTION - Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

ANSWER - Based on the model evaluation I would not feel comfortable using this for trading.  The p-values for the most part are above the 0.05 threshold.  To strenghten the model to feel more comfortable using it for trading we would need more data to plug into it.


REGRESSION ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------
QUESTION - Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data as compared to in-sample data?

ANSWER - The out of sample root mean squared error is lower than the in sample rmse.  Usually these numbers are opposite, the in sample rmse is typically lower for the training data since the model has seen this data already and the testing data is usually new to the model causing the rmse to he higher for the out-of-sample data.
